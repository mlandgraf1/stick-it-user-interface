# Stick It User Interface


## Application Purpose
The Stick It application is a web application that is used to determine what hockey stick works best for a player based on the input provided by the user. This application is meant to solve the problem of young hockey players and casual adult players having difficulties identifying what kind of hockey stick best fits their needs as a player. Stick It will solve this problem by using information inputted by the user to determine a hockey stick that best matches their criteria.


## Role of the User Interface
The User Interface will be the part of the application that the user can see and knowingly interact with. The user will utilize the user interface to enter user information from drop down selection menus about their age, height, weight, hockey position, playing style, and the maximum price they would like to spend on a stick. When the user clicks the submit button of the user interface, the next screen will show the results to the user of the hockey stick that matched their criteria. It will show them the stick's name, flex, curve, age level, price, and photo, as well as a link that they can go to in order to purchase that stick. This will help the users to determine the trickier characteristics of a stick such as the flex and curve without spending hours trying to figure out what configuration would work best for them.
